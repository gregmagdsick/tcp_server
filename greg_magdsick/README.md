This module creates a TCP server that listens to port 7000 and logs the header data to a new file for each request to the server.

##To run
You can start the server by typing 'node index.js' in the command line when in the base directory of the module.

Then, to access the server, the easiest way to do so is to type 'curl localhost:7000' in the command line

The output files are created in the /dat directory.

##To test
type 'gulp test' in the command line to lint all the files, as well as run the tests that are in the /test folder.


###Acnnowledgements
I received help from Tyler Morgan, and I discussed this module with Phillip Nguyen, who helped me troubleshoot my code.
